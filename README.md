Sales Performance Analysis of AfriShop Limited (Branches A, B, and C) using Microsoft Excel

Background
AfriShop Limited is a fast-growing retail and distribution company in Nigeria with operations spread
across three strategic branches (A, B, and C). Each branch records its daily sales, but management
currently faces challenges in monitoring and comparing performance across locations. The lack of a
unified and interactive reporting system makes it difficult to track sales growth, identify
top-performing products, evaluate branch-level contributions, and monitor staff productivity. This
project seeks to address these gaps by developing a sales performance analysis dashboard in
Microsoft Excel.

Objectives
- Clean and organize raw sales data from all branches. - Perform exploratory sales analysis by
branch, product, sales representative, and time period. - Design interactive Excel dashboards that
provide clear insights into business performance. - Empower management with actionable
intelligence for decision-making.
Dataset Description
The dataset contains transaction-level sales records from the company’s three branches (A, B, and
C). Attributes include: - Date: The date the sales transaction occurred. - Invoice No: A unique
identifier assigned to each transaction. - Product: The name/description of the product sold. -
Quantity: Number of units sold in the transaction. - Unit Price: The selling price per unit of product. -
Total Amount: Calculated as Quantity × Unit Price. - Sales Rep: The salesperson who executed the
transaction. - Branch: The branch where the transaction occurred (A, B, or C).
Tools and Techniques
- Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning (duplicates, missing values, formatting). - Pivot Tables for
analysis. - Pivot Charts for visualization. - Slicers and Timelines for interactivity. - Dashboard design
for reporting.
Methodology / Tasks
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation - Consolidate branch datasets (A, B, C) into one file. - Remove
duplicates and inconsistencies. - Ensure uniform formatting (dates, numbers, product names). 2.
Data Analysis - Compute key metrics: total sales, average transaction value, product contribution,
sales by rep. - Analyze branch-level performance. - Track sales trends over time
(monthly/quarterly). 3. Dashboard Design - Develop Pivot Tables for each analysis. - Create Pivot
Charts for visualization (bar, column, line, pie). - Add slicers for branch, product, and sales rep
filtering. - Build a one-page interactive sales dashboard.
Expected Deliverables
- A cleaned and well-structured dataset (combined from all 3 branches). - An analytical report
highlighting sales insights. - An interactive Excel dashboard featuring: * Sales by branch. * Sales by
product. * Sales by sales rep. * Sales trends over time. * Comparison of branch contributions.
Expected Outcome
With the new Excel-based BI solution, AfriShop Limited will be able to: - Make data-driven decisions
on sales strategy. - Reward and manage staff based on performance. - Identify and promote
high-demand products. - Spot weak branches and provide targeted support. - Increase overall sales
efficiency and profitability.
